# Problem
* Warehouses get increasingly difficult to sift through the more unorganized items are added.
* Manual organization is labor intensive.

# Solution:
* We propose an autonomous warehouse sorting system using distributed robots.
* The robots find paths to items for retrieval and drop off using A*. They coordinate collisions with a central controller.
* We have visualized this in the Pygame engine.

# How to execute code:
* Must use Python version >= 3.10
* Use the Python package manager, pip, to install the `pygame` module.
* Run `main.py` using the Python interpreter. Ex: `python3 main.py`
